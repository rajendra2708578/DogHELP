            <h2>The dogs lives for the dog,the hour,even the moment.</h2>
            <p>India's street dog population is closely associated with municipal sanitation practices – or neglect
                thereof. Because these homeless dogs often survive by scavenging rubbish, exposed garbage means more
                healthy dogs – and more puppies. Ironically, this actually makes the dogs a boon to public sanitation.

                thousands of street dogs from partner organizations</p>

                <strong>Domestication</strong>
                <p>For thousands of years humans have changed the morphology, physiology, and behavior of dogs through
                    selective breeding. Canines were the earliest domesticated animal, a process that started somewhere
                    between 15,000 and 30,000 years ago, most likely when gray wolves began scavenging around human
                    settlements</p>

                <strong>Dog Breeds</strong>
                <p>People have been breeding dogs since prehistoric times. The earliest dog breeders used wolves to
                    create domestic dogs.There are over 340 dog breeds known throughout the world. The American Kennel
                    Club recognizes 197 breeds.</p>

                <strong>Best Friend!</strong>
                <p>Through the ages, people have claimed dogs as one of their closest, and best, companions. Of all the
                    domesticated animals, dogs serve the widest array of roles: protector, helper, lifesaver, and
                    companion. Dogs are incredible friends to people, and they’ve been companions through centuries. The
                    relationship between dogs and people is deep and old.

                    wild dog landrace. The Indian pariah dog was one of the first dogs to be domesticated by human
                    beings dating back to the Neolithic era. It is easy to train and is often used as a police dog or
